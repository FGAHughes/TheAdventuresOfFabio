# TheAdventuresOfFabio
This was a game created for an assignment for my principles of programming module during my MSc Comp Sci degree. The assignment involved being able to play a java game, created by the university, not being able to see the code, and being tasked with recreating the game as accurately and efficiently as possible. I achieved 95% for this assignment.
